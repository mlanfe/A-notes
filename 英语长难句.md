## 英语长难句

 12##### 

## 补充

### **祈使句** 

1. 通常以动词原形开头，句子主语通常省略，隐含为 **“you”**。
2. 用来表达请求、命令、建议、劝告或邀请的句子类型。
3. 祈使句也是完整的句子, 和其他句子使用的时候也需要连词
4. 例:
   - *Close the door.*
   - *Please sit down.*
   - *(You) Be quiet.*
   - *(You) Read this book carefully.*





### **状语从句的省略**

​	1. 主句的主语和从句的**主语一致**, 同时从句的谓语中含有**be动词**, 可以省略从句中的主语和被动词

​	例: Though he was blamed, he never changed his mind, 可以省略为:
​	      Though blamed,  he never changed his mind



### **主语从句**

- i believe **that god is a girl**:  	that god is a girl作宾语从句
- **that god is a girl** is obvious:       
  -  that god is a girl 作主语从句
  - 但是一般主语从句有时候会有点**头重脚轻**, 所以使用**形式主语**, 把重点放在一个句子的后面
    改成:  it  is obvious that god is a girl. 其中it作形式主语, 真正的主语是that引导的从句
  - **It is important to study every day.**
    it作形式主语. **to do something**是真正的主语, 和that引导的主语从句享受同样的地位
- 形式主语开头的**主语从句**有两种形式
  - **It is + adj + that + 句子**
  - **It is + adj + to do**
- it is difficult **to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of forty** to image a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most big-city newspapers
  - 加粗部分全都是一个个的介词短语, 作状语
  - 主语从句实际是: it is difficult to image a time



### that引导的从句对比

同位语从句: I have a piece of news to you that you get an offer from Yale

定语从句: I have a piece of news to you that comes from Yale

宾语从句: I believe that you can make it

表语从句: The fact is that god is a girl

主语从句: That god is a girl is obvious
		  It is obvious that god is a girl

**只有定语从句里的句子不完整, 其他从句中的句子都是完整的**

要判断定语从句到底是修饰那个名词/名词结构, 就是一个原则: 定语从句不能跨越谓语, 去修饰谓语前的名词.
定语从句**没有**就近原则, 要联系上下文







### **长句解析demo**

英语中, 逗号可以几乎可以加在任何地方, 主要是为了清晰, 方便阅读 ???

#### 例1: 

**it is advisable to find out what its advocates are aiming at, for , however unreasonable their principles may seem today, it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal**

解析: 

- 此处for做连词, 译为'因为', 引导原因状语从句
- however unreasonable their principles may seem today . 无论他们的原则在今天看起来多么遥不可及.

  - **插入语**，表示转折或强调某个观点的极端性。插入语用逗号隔开是英语的常规做法，

  - **however/whatever + adj/adv + 完整的句子** 此时however/whatever 译为**无论如何多**
- it is advisable to find out what its advocates are aiming at

  - it是**形式主语**
  - **to find out something是主语从句**
  - what its advocates are aiming at是宾语从句
- it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal

  - it是形式主语, that引导**主语从句**, they may be regarded as normal是真正的主语
  - 加上逗号可以拆解为:
    it is possible that, in years to come, they may be regarded as normal
    解析: in years to come 介词短语作状语, 放在句子开头, 通常可以加逗号



#### 例2: 

In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself, for when you know exactly what you have to offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.

分析:

- In making a blueprint for a job, 介词短语做状语, 在句子开头用逗号分隔, 增加阅读性
- begin with yourself 祈使句
- for: 此处作连词而不是介词, 译为'因为'. 连接句子. 如果不做连词, 那么上面的句子将会是一个病句



#### 例3: 

The railway companies, though still private business managed for the benefits of shareholders,  were very unlike old family business

- managed这个不是过去式, 而是过去分词表被动
- though引导状语从句, 省略了主语和be动词  though (the railway companies were) still...



##  主干: 

找主干主要是三个步骤:

	1. 找连词
	1. 找(谓语)动词
	1. 找介词



###   连词

逗号不能直接连接完整句子, 要通过连词

**n个连词可以连接n+1个句子**

##### 1. 并列连词

and, or, but, yet

- 连接前后**成分相同**. 可以连接句子, 可以连接单词, etc

- **从后往前判断**
  - 


##### 2. 从属连词

- 无词义, 不做成分:
  -  `that if`, whether
- 连接代词
  - who, whom, whose, what, which, whatever whoever, whichever
- 连接副词
  - when, where why,how, however, whenever, wherever
  - 关系副词连接的从句是完整的。 因为副词不能做主谓宾，所以从句是完整的。
    而连词代词可以在从句中做主宾，所以连接代词连接的从句可以是不完整的，
    而that不作成分， 无词义, 所以that引导的从句中, 除了定语从句, 其它都是完整的句子

总结来说: 

1. 从属连词就是w开头的连词+ that+其他连词(if, though, although, as其实也可以做连词)
2. 其他
   1. 从属连词可以直接跟**动词不定式**
      - you can plan where to go
      - you can tell me what to do
      - you can tell me which to choose
   2. 





###  动词: 谓语, 非谓语

看一个成分是否是一个句子, 就是看这个成分有没有谓语动词

**谓语动词**是一个句子的核心

谓语动词的五种形式: (判断一个动词是不是谓语)
```
1. 第一二人称 + 动词原形/第三人称单数
2. be + ving
3. 情态动词 + do
4. have/has/had + done
5. be + done
```





英语中的时态是指动词的不同形式，用来表示动作或状态发生的时间、持续的状态或完成的程度。英语有12种时态，可以分为**简单时态、进行时态、完成时态**和**完成进行时态**四类。态总结表

###  介词

**介词短语**

介词短语通常用作**状语**，在句子中表示时间、地点、原因、方式、条件等信息，修饰动词、形容词或副词。

**介词短语中, 介词引导的成分通常是名词**,  

​	介词短语通常是**介词+名词**, 在句子中的成分是作状语, 和**连词**连接的**状语从句**不一样

常见的有: in, on, at, of, off, with

**介词引导的成分永远不作主干**

- 主干成分是: **主谓宾**. 
- 非主干成分是: 定语, 状语, 补语, 也就是**定状补**
  - 定语用来修饰名词, 名词可以用作主语, 也可以用作宾语, 也就是定语是用来修饰主语和宾语的
  - 补语分为**主语补足语**和**宾语补足语**
  - **修饰谓语的就是状语**.  
    因为谓语是整个句子的灵魂, 所以修饰谓语, 也可以看成是修饰整个句子





- 介词短语作时间状语 In the morning, I like to go jogging.
- 介词短语作地点状语 He lives in New York.
- 介词短语作方式状语 They canceled the meeting because of the weather.
- 介词短语作条件状语 With hard work, you will succeed.
- 介词短语作目的状语 He studied for the test.







**介词短语位于句首时**，通常加逗号，尤其是当介词短语较长或复杂时。
**介词短语位于句尾时**，一般不加逗号，除非句子结构较复杂或短语较长。

- She managed the project efficiently, with a great deal of support from her team.
- She visited us in the summer.
- In case of emergency, please call this number.
- Of all the components of a good night's sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control.
  - Of all the components of a good night's sleep是一个**介词短语**作状语, 但不是状语从句, 因为of后面跟的是一个名词而不是一个句子
- Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century, perhaps the most far reaching has been the inexorable decline in the scope and seriousness of their arts coverage
  - Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century 是状语, 不是状语从句







## 非主干: 句型结构

主干结构是: 主谓宾: s+v+o; 主系表

非主干在开头和结尾时, 逗号大多还可以省略

```
1. --, s+v+o
2. s+v+o,--
3. s,--, v+o
```

###  --, s+v+o

####  1. 状语从句 

​	When i was young, i can play football

#### 2. 介词结构 

​	On Sunday morning, we go to school
​	这里的介词短语做状语, 但是不是从句

#### 3. 分词结构 

- Fining my homework, i start to watch TV

  解析: 

  上面其实是两个句子:
  i finish my homework, i start to watch TV

  两个完整的句子不能用逗号分隔, 所以要把其中一个变成不完整的句子. 
  可以通过把其中一个句子的谓语动词, 改成非谓语动词, 来使其变成不完整的句子
  i finishing my home work, i start to watch TV

  因为主语相同, 所以省略前面不完整句子的主语
  Finishing my homework, i start to watch TV

- he was sentenced to death, he went to prison. (有语病, 逗号连接了两个完整句子)

  可以改为: 

  - when he was sentenced to death, he went to prison.
  - Sentenced to death, he went to prison
  
- A component should present properties and methods for data binding, **to mediate **between the view (rendered by the template) and the application logic (which often includes some notion of a model).

  - 这里的to mediate是动词不定式, 使得后面的一个句子构成分词结构

分词结构还可以做定语， 作定语表示定语从句的省略

- The man who is standing there is my teacher.

- The man standing there is my teacher.

  


**谓语动词变成非谓语动词的三种形式**

```
1. ving
2. ved
3. to do

判断应该使用ving还是ved, 主要看主语和谓语动词的主被动关系, 
如果是主动, 就使用ving, 如果是被动就使用ved
```

​	

上面的demo, 因为主语相同可以省略, 要是主语不同没法省略, 就变成了独立主格



#### 4. 独立主格 

- He finishing his homework, i start to watch TV
- ATM being in process, please wait
  - please wait是祈使句. 祈使句其实都是**省略主语**, 这里省略了主语you

#### 5. 副词 

​	Surprisingly, he is still alive





### s, --, v+o

#####  1. 状语从句 

​	I, when i was young, can play football

##### 2. 介词结构 

​	we, on Sunday morning, go to school

##### 3. 分词结构 

​	I, fining my homework, start to watch TV

##### 4. 独立主格 

​	I, he finishing his homework, start to watch TV

##### 5. 副词 

​	He, surprisingly,  is still alive





6和7是两种特殊情况, 7其实是由6演变而来.
6中定语从句修饰名词shanghai, **省略定语从句中的连词和谓语动词可以直接得到同位语,** 形成了7的名词结构



##### 6. 定语从句 

​	Shanghai, which is a moving city, is my hometown

##### 7. 名词结构 (同位语)

​	Shanghai,  a moving city, is my hometown

### s+v+o, --

#####  1. 状语从句 

​	when i was young, I can play football

##### 2. 介词结构 

​	we go to school, on Sunday morning

##### 3. 分词结构 

​	I start to watch TV, fining my homework

##### 4. 独立主格 

​	I start to watch TV, he finishing his homework

##### 5. 副词 

​	He is still alive, surprisingly

##### 6. 定语从句 

​	Shanghai is my hometown, which is a moving city

##### 7. 名词结构 (同位语)

​	Shanghai is my hometown, a moving city
